# Classification-of-Benign-and-Malignant-Tumors-Using-SVM
This project implements a binary classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. Based on a medical dataset, the model analyzes specific tumor characteristics to provide accurate and reliable predictions, supporting medical diagnostics.
